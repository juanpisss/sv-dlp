## Changelog
The functionality of sv-dlp's back-end can now be utilized as a constructor in other scripts, providing developers to 
easily incorporate the functionality of sv-dlp into their own projects. This makes it possible to access the various 
features and capabilities of sv-dlp, such as the ease of metadata scrapping between different services,
panorama download & stitching, etc.
