# Welcome to the sv-dlp documentation!

sv-dlp is a versatile panorama scraper for a wide range of street view platforms. 
It is designed to make it easy for terminal users & developers to download panoramic images, 
acquire detailed metadata, and generate short URLs for the panoramas. The tool is built with a robust 
back-end that can handle multiple services and provides a wide range of functionalities 
such as the ability to extract metadata information, handle panorama stitching, and much more. 
Furthermore, it is designed to be easily integrable with other scripts, providing developers with 
the flexibility to incorporate its capabilities into their own projects and applications.

For terminal users, check out `CLI` for getting started and supported commands.
For developers, check out `Module Basics`, and `Contributing Basics`; `Class Documentation` for more information 
regarding sv_dlp classes, available methods, downloading process, and more.

## Important Note
This project is under active development.

sv-dlp heavily relies on reverse-engineered APIs to function, as such, it is dependent on the 
stability and availability of these APIs; it's important to note that some services might change
their APIs without notice. In the event of a service not working properly, it is 
recommended to submit an issue with the Dead API label, this way, I (or a collaborator) can investigate 
and resolve the issue as soon as possible. Additionally, some services might have limitations on usage 
and it's important to respect them. In any case, I will do my best to keep sv-dlp up to date and working 
smoothly for all supported services.
