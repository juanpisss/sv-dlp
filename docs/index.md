# Welcome to the sv-dlp documentation!

sv-dlp is a powerful scraper for street view platforms. It simplifies downloading panoramic images,
fetching metadata, and creating short URLs. This tool offers extensive functionality, including metadata
extraction and panorama stitching. It's highly adaptable, allowing developers to integrate it into their
projects.

For terminal users, check out `CLI` for getting started and supported commands.
For developers, check out `Module Basics`, and `Contributing Basics`; `Class Documentation` for more information
regarding sv_dlp classes, available methods, downloading process, and more.

## Important Note

This project is under active development.

sv-dlp heavily relies on reverse-engineered APIs to function, as such, it is dependent on the
stability and availability of these APIs; it's important to note that some services might change
their APIs without notice. In the event of a service not working properly, it is
recommended to submit an issue with the Dead API label, this way, I (or a collaborator) can investigate
and resolve the issue as soon as possible. Additionally, some services might have limitations on usage
and it's important to respect them. In any case, I will do my best to keep sv-dlp up to date and working
smoothly for all supported services.
