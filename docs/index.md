# Welcome to the sv-dlp documentation!

**sv-dlp** is a Python library and CLI program
designed as a front-end API for various Street View services. 
With a given input (such as a Panorama ID or coordinates), it can
obtain metadata information, download its corresponding panorama,
and translate to a shortened URL (as long as the service supports it).

For terminal users, check out `CLI` for getting started and supported commands.
For developers, check out `Module Basics` and `Class Documentation` for more information 
regarding sv_dlp classes, available methods, downloading process, and more.

## Important Note
This project is under active development.

As sv-dlp relies on reverse engineered API calls,
any service can be broken if any internal change is made.
In the case of an event like that, please submit an issue regarding a Dead API.
